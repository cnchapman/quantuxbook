				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h4>Who is this book written for?</h4>
                <p>We wrote with the following readers in mind:
                <ul>
                    <li>UX Researchers who wish to develop skills in Quant UX, or switch to a Quant UX role</li>
                    <li>Current Quant UX researchers looking for example projects or career advice</li>
                    <li>Data scientists working with UX teams or considering a move to UX</li>
                    <li>Students, academics, and faculty who want to understand the approaches and necessary skills for Quant UX</li>
                    <li>UX managers who wish to build, develop, or understand the Quant UX research role</li>
                    <li>Anyone applying or interviewing for Quant UX positions</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h4>What is unique about the book?</h4>
            <p>It is a complete overview of Quant UX and focuses on the day to day realities of Quant UX practice. It defines the skills that are needed and places them into context with example projects and discussion of organizations and careers.</p>
            <p>The book does <i>not</i> repeat basic instruction on programming or statistics. Rather, it outlines and builds on those foundations to describe the unique aspects of Quant UX and how to succeed in quant UX projects and roles.</p>
            <p>Technical chapters present detailed discussion and R code (where appropriate) of product log sequence analysis; customer satisfaction surveys; the HEART framework for UX metrics; and MaxDiff choice surveys.</p>
                
                <h4>I try a command from the book in R and I get "<code>Error: could not find function</code> ...". What's up?</h4>
                <p>That means either the command is mistyped, or more likely you need to load a library that enables it.</p>
                <p>Check your typing, and if that doesn't fix it, look back through the chapter for a <code>library()</code> command that you might have missed. To search installed R libraries on your system to see which one has the command, you can also use "<code>??</code>".</p>

                <h4>I’m an instructor and considering using <i>The Definitive Guide to Quantitative User Experience Research</i> in a class. Are there exercises and course materials available?</h4>
                <p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

                <p><b>Yes!</b> Slides are now available in R markdown (R presentation) format -- with .R code snippets for students to use to follow along, and HTML presentation for the classroom. <a href="Instructor/slides-index.html">Slides are here</a>. Also, we'd be interested to hear about your class. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:eleafeit+bookinstructor@gmail.com">eleafeit+bookinstructor@gmail.com</a>, and let us know what types of students you teach and how you are thinking of using the book.</p>

                <p>Note that the primary goal of this book is a text to help professionals who work with marketing data to master R. Of course, students are future professionals and we think the book will be useful to them, too.</p>
                
                <p>If you want your students to develop strong R skills, we suggest using the book in a “workshop” format course where students sit at computers and work together through the examples with guidance from an instructor. We are also assembling a set of exercises for each chapter that can be used for evaluating students mastery of the material.</p>
